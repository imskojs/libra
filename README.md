# Notes on Libra White Paper.

## Introduction

* 1.7 billion adults remain outside of the financial system.

* People with less money pay more for financial services. (remittances, wirecosts, overdraft, ATM charges, financial charges)

* We (Libra) believe that collaborating and innovating with the financial sector, including regulators and experts across a variety of industries, is the only way to ensure that a sustainable, secure and trusted framework underpins this new system.

* What Libra tries to achieve;
  * More people to financial assets.
  * Right to control the fruit of labor.
  * global, instant movement of money. 
  * People will increasingly trust decentrailzed forms of govt.
  * Global currency, financial infrastructure should be governed as a public good.
  * uphold the inegrity of the current ecosystem (non-destructive)
